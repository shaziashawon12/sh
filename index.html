<h1>A road accident</h1>
<p>The phenomenon of road accidents is common in our country. Drivers are responsible for it because they are careless on the road. It snatches away valuable lives. It leaves many people seriously injured.
    Suddenly, a little boy living in the slum by the roadside crossed the road to go to the other side. In this case, the driver was unable to control the speed because of his sudden movement. The child was immediately pressed into a lump of blood and bone after being struck by the pickup van. The child died before anyone could do anything.
    Immediately a hue and cry roared. As the parents came out of the roadside slum, they screamed heartbreakingly. The total atmosphere became heavy with their lamentations. Many people gathered around the road, including students from our school. Someone began to hurl angry words, shart comments, and dirty abuses at the driver.
    This pathetic and heartbreaking scene greatly shocked me. The sight of the childâ€™s flesh and blood almost suffocated me; my blood circulation seemed to have been suspended. I will never forget the memory of this tragic road accident.
